# freecodecamp-javascript-us-phone-number-validation-checker
Built a validator for US phone number with some nice features. Got some help from StackOverflow, W3C Schools, other websites and Claude. Part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification (project 3 of 5).

This project has some nice features. You're able to submit a lot of differently formatted US numbers, as well as featuring a sliding window UI and the possibility to enter a number by a keystroke too :-)
